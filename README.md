This source is pretty fresh but not known how old, now compilable for vrchat update fully working.
Have fun, and explore how pasted abyss is while also saying that muenchen is a paste.
You can do whatever with this source, since it's been fixed enjoy!

TO FUSL:
- Thanks for being the right hand for a well known german paster in the vrc community and banning people for him
- Thanks for getting me into client dev through doing that. It is a fun journey till now
- Thanks for making perma bans for no reasons. That leads to people doing more stuff because they'll get banned anyways

TO THE GERMAN PASTER:
- Why can't you just leave people alone?

CREDITS:
